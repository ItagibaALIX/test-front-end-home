See example in folder /screenshots

Requirement:
- Create a second table with the data of the following public API endpoint: https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json
- Use react query to fetch the data
- Add a button "Update" above the table
- You must fetch only when clicking on this "Update" button 
- When clicking on a array's row, it must open a drawer
- In this drawer you must create a form which can overide endpoint's data 
- This form must be created with the library useForm
- It must override only when clicking on the "Save" button  
- Clicking on the "Save" button must close the drawer
- If you click on the "Update" button you must reset the table with the latest data coming from the endpoint.
- Use the screenshots in the folder /Screenshots as base for your work.
- You can use any kind of tools (internet, chatgpt...)
- We expect a delivery with clean code
- If you think that some code already in the code base needs a quick revamp, please do it.
